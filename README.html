<h1>Maman 01</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] implement the <code>ps</code> system call</li>
<li>[ ] the system call name must be cps1xx where xx are the last 2 digits of my
ID.</li>
<li>[ ] WTF requirement - the system call number must be equal to the digits
following cps??? tf does that mean u hallucinating bruh?</li>
<li>[ ] the implementation must be done in a file called <em>ps.c</em> <strong>unlike</strong> the
system call name itself which is called <code>cps1xx</code> and not <code>ps</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>Only the following files need to be added/changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>ps.c - create and modify as needed.</li>
<li>proc.c - modify as needed.</li>
<li>syscall.c - modify exactly 2 lines.</li>
<li>usys.S - modify as needed.</li>
<li>sysproc.c - modify as needed.</li>
<li>user.h - modify exactly 1 line.</li>
<li>defs.h - modify exactly 1 line.</li>
<li>Makefile - modify to fit and support the latest modifications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> modify <em>syscall.h</em>, instead, understand the structure of data in
<em>syscall.c</em> and find another way to bypass the limitations imposed by this
restriction.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> modify <em>usys.s</em>, make use of the custom changes already made to it
to implement the <em>fork</em> syscall as an example.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The implementation differs in some ways from the implementations that can be
found in the manual guides.</p>
<p>In order to be able to print <em>PPID</em> and <em>SIZE</em> fields, one must fetch their
values from the OS's <strong><em>PCB (Process-Control-Block)</em></strong> structure.</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>The title of the output must be printed via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">cprintf(&quot;name \t pid \t state \t \t ppid \t size \n&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>and the output contents must be identical to the university's image solution.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>PPID</em> field of <em>INIT</em> <strong>must be equal to 0.</strong></p>
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p>To validate your solution, before uploading it:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Rebuild and rerun the entire system emulation and OS to ensure it
compiles and that the outputs are all valid.</li>
<li>[ ] After running <code>make clean</code> run <code>make qemu</code> and ensure that the output is
still valid.</li>
<li>[ ] Shut down the QEMU emulator, and run the tests with
<code>./runtests.exp my.log</code>, you may need to modify the file permissions of
<em>runtests.exp</em> to successfully run the tests.</li>
<li>[ ] Make sure that the script exit status is zero (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uploading</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following files are the only ones that may be modified or added to and are
the only files that must be zipped as part of the solution: <br />
<em>usys.S</em>, <em>defs.h</em>, <em>user.h</em>, <em>ps.c</em>, <em>proc.c</em>, <em>syscall.c</em>, <em>sysproc.c</em>, <em>Makefile</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The files shall be zipped into a zip archive called ex01.zip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comment must be included in every source file in the zip with
a general description of the file, student name, and ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Re-Validation??</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Unzip ex01.zip</li>
<li>[ ] Extract original maman01.zip files into a brand new directory</li>
<li>[ ] Extract and copy all files from ex01.zip solution into the new xv6 directory</li>
<li>[ ] Re run the build and ensure it builds without any errors or warnings and
runs correctly producing correct output results as specified in previous
sections of this README file.</li>
</ul>
